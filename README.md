I'm a full stack web developer, former coding bootcamp instructor, and graduate of the SANS/ICMCP Diversity Cyber Academy with 12+ years working in development. I'm a Certified Web Application Penetration Tester (GWAPT), Certified Incident Handler (GCIH), and a member of the GIAC Advisory Board. I know how to build and test beautiful, accessible, and secure websites and applications.

I am a passionate supporter of progressive top-tier organizations, projects, and initiatives dedicated to serving the greater public good. I contribute my skills and talents to human-centered environments that thrive on positivity, enthusiasm, and joy. I believe everyone should feel good about the work they do every day.
